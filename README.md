# Project Customer Form
Projekt Restwert ZÃ¼rich required a tool to register new customers and maintain their data, with the goal of integrating this information into their existing ERP system. The tool needed to be accessible via iPad tablets for ease of use by their team.

Once the customer's data is validated and saved, they will receive an email containing Projekt Restwert's Terms of Service.
